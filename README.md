View the API documentation [here](https://rory652.github.io/3881-project/)

How to run:
1. Clone the repository
2. Create a .env file in the source folder with the following variables - use secure passwords:
```.env
APP_KEY=<key>
SESSION_PASS=<password>
DB_PASS=<password>
```
3. Run `docker compose up` from the source folder
4. Once completed, the API will be accessible through localhost:5000
5. A client will be available at 127.0.0.1:8000 which allows for some simple debugging (place this in a seperate branch later)
